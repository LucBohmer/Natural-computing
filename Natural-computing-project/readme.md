# Evolutionary Checkers

To start the training, run tournament.py, which will start the process and start generating sets of weights into weights.json.
It will also output the average and best score of the generation after each generation.
If you want to continue on a previously trained generation, set start_from_file to True in the main function in tournament.py. 
If you want to change the number of used phases to 2 instead of 3, this can be set in the phases parameter also in the main function in tournament.py.

An example terminal output while training the evolutionary algorithm can be seen below
